We invite you to participate in a research study about the daily uses of Google Voice Assistants. This consent form is part of an informed consent process for a research study and it will provide information that will help you decide whether you want to take part in this study.  It is your choice to take part or not.


</b><br> </b><br> 


<b>Purpose of this resarch</b><br>
we want to learn more about how you use Google Assistant. Your participation will help us better understand how people are using these technologies, and provide better services in the future. You can only take part in this study if you are 18  years of age or older and live in the United States or Canada. 

We are looking for a broad range of people who use Google Assistant. We will ask you some questions about how you currently use Google Assistant and what features you might want to add. We will also ask you to share your Google Assistant History with us. We will be studying this history to understand the overarching categories of Assistant Use, like “search,” or “music” -- and not for any particular search/command. You will have a chance to remove any information that you might deem too sensitive to share. 

We will protect your privacy by masking private data (including images, addresses, names, telephone numbers) using a script and letting you review the results before they are uploaded.
All your survey answers and uploaded logs will be covered by Mozilla's <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/privacy/">Privacy Policy</a> , and at no point will we share any of your data with anyone outside of the research team or with any other company, and at no point will we link it to any online identifier, such as your email address or Reddit account. The results of this survey will be reported in aggregate ("28% of queries were about music"), and any quotes you give us will be anonymized ("A 23-year-old told us they 'couldn't do without music'").  We have used this approach before, looking at smart speaker data, in our paper <a href="https://sites.rutgers.edu/tawfiq-ammari/wp-content/uploads/sites/480/2020/06/Ammari_TOCHI_2019.pdf">Music, search and IoT: How people (really) use voice assistants</a>.



</b><br> </b><br> 


<b>Description of subject involvement </b><br>

If you agree to take part in the research study, we will ask you to fill out a short survey about your use of Google Voice Assistant. Filling the survey should take around fifteen minutes. One of the questions will ask you to upload your Google Voice Logs. </b><br> </b><br>



<b>Benefits</b><br>

Although you may not directly benefit from being in this study, others may benefit from having a better understanding of how Google Voice Assistants are used in everyday routines.
<br><br>

<b>Risks and Discomforts</b><br>

There is little risk associated with this study. Participating in this study is no more risky than other everyday activities.

<br><br>

<b>Compensation</b><br>
Participants will receive a $10 Amazon.com gift card as a thank you for your time.

<br><br>
<b>Confidentiality</b><br>

To keep your information safe, the researchers will keep your data on password-protected computers. Any personally identifiable information will be removed before the research team accesses your logs, and the results will only use data at an aggregated level, not at the individual level, so any findings will not identify you individually.

<br><br>

<b>Voluntary nature of the study</b><br>
Participating in this study is completely voluntary. Even if you decide to participate now, you may change your mind and stop at any time. However, you will only receive your compensation upon completion of the survey, including the Google Voice Log upload.
