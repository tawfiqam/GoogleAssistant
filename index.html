					<p>
I am a PhD candidate at the <a href="https://www.si.umich.edu/">University of Michigan School of Information</a>.
I am advised by <a href="http://yardi.people.si.umich.edu/"> Prof. Sarita Yardi Schoenebeck</a>.
I am a member of the <a href="http://smrl.sites.uofmhosting.net/"> Social Media Research Lab</a>. I am also enrolled in the
Graduate Certificate program
in <a href="http://www.lsa.umich.edu/sts/"> Science, Technology and Society</a>.
</p>

<p>
My research lies at the intersection of Social Computing, Data Science, and Science, Technology, and Society studies (STS). My work focuses on the interplay between technological and social role change. Specifically, I study how large societal shifts, such as changing norms around masculinity, are associated with online interactions and social movements. I also research how the mass adoption of technologies like social media and emerging technologies like voice assistants affects social roles in the domestic sphere.
<p>

<p>
I am a mixed methods researcher connecting critical theory values from STS with computational social science techniques to advocate for equity and progressive social change in online contexts.

<h3>Projects</h3>
<h4>Assistive Technology, Marginality and Aspiration </h4>
<p>
I worked with <a href="http://joyojeet.people.si.umich.edu/"> Joyojeet Pal</a> on a project studying the use of assistive technology
on the aspirations of persons with disabilities and their feelings of marginality. Assistive technologies allow persons with
disabilities to independently use computers and communication tools (e.g. mobiles). We used survey data (n=176) overlaid
with qualitative data from interviews (n=155) from India, Peru and Jordan to study the effects of AT use on the aspirations of
people with visual impairment. The results of this work are reported in <a href="Pal_Ammari_Acc_Marg_ICTD13.pdf"> Marginality, Aspiration and Accessibility in ICTD</a>.
</p>
<h4>Social Networking Sites, Empowerment and Parents of Children with Special Needs</h4>
<p>
I worked with <a href="http://yardi.people.si.umich.edu/">Sarita Yardi</a> and <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/merrie/"> Meredith Ringel Morris</a>
on a project studying the use of social networking sites by parents of children with special needs. We used mixed methods, starting with
interviewing parents (n=43) and using emerging themes to create a survey (n=205). We found that parents of children with special needs
feel less stigmatized in their online interactions than they are when interacting with family members & medical professional offline.
Parents were usually members of two kinds of Facebook groups and listservs: (1) geographical-based groups (e.g. in a city or neighborhood) and
(2) case-based groups (e.g. autism). These results were published in <a href="Ammari_SpecialNeedsParents_ICWSM14.pdf">ICWSM'14</a> and summarized in this
<a href="http://crowdresearch.org/blog/?p=8579">blog entry</a>.
We have also introduced the concept of networked empowerment as parents understand their children's condition, gain more access to services
and gain more self-efficacy through cultivating relationships in social networking cites. These results are published in <a href="Ammari_SpecialNeeds_CHI15.pdf">CHI'15</a>.

</p>
<h4>How Parents Manage Disclosure on Social Networking Sites</h4>
<p>
Working with <a href="http://yardi.people.si.umich.edu/">Sarita Yardi</a>, we interviewed 37 fathers about the challenges they face
with self-disclosure on social networking sites. Fathers are normatively expected to be the primary breadwinners in the family. Moreover,
fathers do not have as many chances to practice parenting in their youth when compared to young women. The challenges they face when
using social networking sites are different than those mothers face. Fathers ask more questions about how to be good fathers especially
when they lack adequate fatherhood models as they are growing up. They also use social networking sites to access social support and
document their changing roles as fathers. They use different social networking sites (e.g., Facebook, reddit, Twitter etc.) for different
purposes. For example, fathers used blogs primarily to document their fatherhood, and single fathers made more use of anonymous
social networking sites like reddit. The results are published in <a href="Ammari_Fathers_CHI15.pdf">CHI'15</a>.
</p>

<p>
We also worked with <a href="http://clifflampe.org/"> Cliff Lampe</a> and <a href="https://www.si.umich.edu/people/priya-kumar"> Priya Kumar</a>
to study shared disclosure management by mothers and fathers. We introduce the concept of the "Third Shift" based on
Hochschild's <i>Second Shift</i> to describe parents' articulation work to manage posts about their children online.
We analyzed 102 interviews from our broader research projects. We found that mothers usually take more of the responsibility in management
disclosure than fathers. Parents made use of the different affordances of social networking sites to limit over sharing and target different
audiences. The results are published in <a href="Ammari_ManagingChildrensIdentities_CHI15.pdf">CHI'15</a>.
